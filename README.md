In the project aimed at optimizing term deposit sales, I initiated the process with detailed data preprocessing, including the careful treatment of missing values and the transformation of categorical variables. This was followed by insightful feature engineering to enhance the dataset's predictive potential. Selecting a Random Forest Classifier for its robust adaptability to complex datasets, they meticulously tuned the model, incorporating SMOTE to mitigate class imbalance challenges This led me to provide recommendations to enhance marketing strategies and improve customer satisfaction and subscription rates.

In this project, I applied an unsupervised learning technique using the RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary Value) model to segment the e-commerce website's customers into distinct groups. By conducting extensive descriptive statistics, I established a refined dataset that facilitated the segmentation process. Utilizing the K-Means clustering algorithm, I classified customers into mutually exclusive groups based on their purchasing patterns. This enabled the creation of personalized recommendations for each segment, significantly enhancing the potential for increased sales and customer engagement.
